A friend didn't want to upload his bookmarks file online to have it decoded, and FireFox would OVERWRITE the old ones, so he asked for help...
Simply save it locally and drag&drop your jsonlz4 FireFox bookmarks to have it decoded, fully local.

<h2>NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES WHATSOEVER!</h2>
<h2>The LZ4 is decoded "byte by byte" manually</h2>
